# WIP

Nearly nothing works.

## What

Have you ever wondered how much you or your co-workers actually curse in your
commit messages? Worry no more, `git-anger-management` is here to help you.
Simply run it against your repository and it'll tell you who is the naughtiest
of them all.

## Why

Some times the only way to vent at the ridiculous crap we make is to write
really angry commit messages, I do it all the time. And I wanted to know just
how angry I am.

# Installation

Make sure you have Rust installed (I recommend installing via
[rustup](https://rustup.rs/)), then run `cargo install git-anger-management`.
You can now check how naughty you are by running `git anger-management`.
